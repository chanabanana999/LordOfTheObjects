## Lord Of The Objects
Homework Assignment #2

### Overview
In this game the player is a female Kraken who takes on three heroes: Captain Kirk, Luke Skywalker and Wonder Woman. Our team used methods, classes and objects to create modular code for a menu-based game.

### How to Play
The player chooses from 3 attack methods to attack her opponent. The Kraken and each character each have health factors that will be diminished in each attack. Each side inflicts damage. Whichever character reaches a zero health factor (which kills off that character) first loses that round. Attack and defense methods have random point values, so it is not a given that a certain outcome will be achieved.
If the Kraken survives the confrontation with Captain Kirk, she will then face off against Luke Skywalker. The combat continues until one of them reaches a zero health factor.
If the Kraken survives again, she will face off against Wonder Woman.

### Lessons Learned

I learned that.....
it's much easier to manage code one time than repeat the same thing multiple times.
It's very very helpful to have a flow of what's going to happen and break everything down step by step.
A simpler design is easier to execute.
Understanding the logical flow of the program is essential.
A decent game will probably take some revision and more time to complete.
